Submission contents:
- React + Vite frontend with Tailwind CSS
- Clean components for Login and Tasks
- API wrapper that falls back to a mock implementation (so app works standalone)
- Build-ready via `npm run build`
- Simple test using Vitest

How to run:
1. npm install
2. npm run dev
3. open http://localhost:5173

Notes:
- Replace VITE_API_BASE with your backend URL to integrate with a real API.
- Demo credentials (mock): demo@example.com / pass
